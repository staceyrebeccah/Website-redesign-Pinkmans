# Website redesign using Bootstrap
  <p>Despite being one of Bristol's most standout bakeries in person, with their reknowned sour-doughnuts on offer and quirky interior, their website was <em>crumby</em> to say the least. I decided that redesigning their website was the <em>yeast</em> I could do - they deserved <em>butter</em> than what they had. Problem was, they <em>bread</em> my mind! I redesigned their previous website, and they did the same. Here's the latest version of their website (https://pinkmans.co.uk/). It's less in <em>knead</em> of a redesign than before, but I've still decided to <em>rise</em> to the occasion, so keep reading for the specifics...
  <ul>
    <li>This simple website was built using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 4.</li>
    <li>It's a one-pager with anchor tags and external links in the nav to Pinkmans seperate Shop / Order pages.</li> 
    <li>Their extensive menu is contained within a dropdown (powered by Javascript), to allow the user to only show the section of the menu that they're interested in.</li>
    <li>On a mobile, this website offers a collapsible navigation menu, along with responsive features.</li>
    <li>The gallery uses Flexbox to give a responsive Instagram gallery, with CSS filters on hover.</li>
    <li>The Find Us section uses a grid for the two column layout, which becomes one column on a mobile.</li>
  </ul>
